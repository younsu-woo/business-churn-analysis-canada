# Business Churn Analysis in Canada
## Project Purpose:question:
To demonstrate an API based ETL pipeline in Python and data visualization in Tableau.
<br><br>

## Project Overview :mag:
This project is intended to explore the business landscape in Canada across regions, industries, and times periods. There are four components 
this project will try to cover:

**1. Trend analysis**<br>
Identify trends in the business environment, such as seasonal variations or changes in the business climate that could affect the survival of businesses.

**2. Geographical analysis**<br>
Identify business trends in specific geographic areas. By analyzing data by location, we can identify where businesses are more likely to succeed or fail, 
or where there are opportunities for growth.

**3. Risk assessment**<br>
Assess risk of starting a new business in a particular industry or location, and identify potential risks and make more informed decisions.

**4. Comparative analysis**<br>
Compare the performance of business across different industries, locations, and time periods. By analyzing data on similar businesses, we can identify 
best practices, success factors, and opportunities for improvement.

## Technology :computer:
- Language: Python
- Data Format: JSON/CSV
- Data Processing: Requests, JSON, Pandas, NumPy
- Visualization: Tableau
<br><br>

## Methodology :memo:
Download data from Statistics Canada using Requests and parse the JSON data string to a Python object. Pre-process and clean data using Python by deleting categories that are 
not relevant to this project, and save it as a pandas dataframe in a CSV file. Upload the CSV file in Tableau and create a dashboard.
